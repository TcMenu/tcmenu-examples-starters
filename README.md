## Java examples

### Setting up a Java build

For development we recommend IntelliJ, either edition of it should be fine to get started with. To build on the command line, ensure that you have the most recent OpenJDK and a recent version of maven on your system, without these it will not be possible to build.

* All OpenJDK's that we've tested work for this, we've tried: Liberica, Adoptium, Amazon Corretto and Microsoft JDK.
* For Apache maven we recommend using [https://maven.apache.org/]

Using git or zip download, get the contents of the tcMenu repository locally, for example:

    git clone https://github.com/TcMenu/tcmenu-examples-starters.git

Once you've set up the above you can start with any of the following projects:

* embedControlJavaFX: A starting point for deploying a desktop control and monitoring UI app that works on many platforms.
* embeddedJavaDeviceUI: A starting point embedded control application for embedded boards that can run JavaFX.
* javaApiExamples: A number of examples that show various types of connection possibilities with the Java API.
* javaApiWebsocketServer: An example that shows how to use a simple websocket library standalone with a separate web server.
