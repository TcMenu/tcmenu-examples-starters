# TcMenu examples and starter projects

## Licnese

IMPORTANT: Unlike our other open source repositories, most projects in this repository are under a far more restrictive license. The most important differences are that:

* **This is not yet a public release, until then it is privately licensed to TcMenu org only**
* You must not deploy any of these items as-is into any kind of public facing repository.
* We do not give you the right to call a product Embed Control for any purpose outside of your own testing.
* These are provided as-is and we don't release them, or support them directly. Once you've formed them into a suitable form for deployment or use, you should ensure you have your own channels to support them.
* There is also a commercial clause on all the UI products in this repository that should your company exceed the stated turnover then you must acquire a licnese from before deploying anything publicly.

## Java examples

All the examples are set up to work with the latest version of Java `OpenJDK` and `maven` build tool. You can use more or less any OpenJDK distribution, but we tend to use Adoptium at the moment.

* embedControlJavaFX: A starting point for deploying a desktop control and monitoring UI app that works on many platforms.
* embeddedJavaDeviceUI: A starting point embedded control application for embedded boards that can run JavaFX.
* javaApiExamples: A number of examples that show various types of connection possibilities with the Java API.
